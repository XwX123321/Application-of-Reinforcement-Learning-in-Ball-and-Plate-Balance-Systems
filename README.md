# Application-of-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Ball-and-Plate-Balance-Systems
The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is chosen for control, and both actor and critic network models are defined. By integrating optimized parameters into a customized simulation environment, the model is trained to effectively balance the ball. The trained policy is then saved for potential deployment or further analysis.
